# TS Utils

A TypeScript library to provide various mathematical functionalities.

It aims to provide functionality that the standard "Math" library lacks.
It aims to create functions using primitive types, without making them unnecessarily complex.

This library was created to meet personal needs. Feel free to use it, but understand that if something is missing, it hasn't been implemented because I haven't felt the need for that feature yet.

## Features

- Utility functions for common math operations (clamp, approximately, lerp).
- Utility functions for common vectorial operations (dot product, subtraction, scaling, etc).

## Installation

### Using npm

```bash
npm install ts-utils
